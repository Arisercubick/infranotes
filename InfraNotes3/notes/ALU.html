        <h1>ALU (Arithmetc Logic Unit)</h1>
        <p>The ALU is a key part of a cpu (Central Processing Unit)</p>
        <br>
        <p>It performes all the arithmetic and logical operations tat a computer needs<br>to process data</p>

        <h2>Random Access Memory</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It's the main memory of a computer where data and programs are temporarily<br>stored while the CPU is using them.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary</strong>: holds data only while the computer is on. Everything is lost when the power is turned off.<br>(That's why it's called volatile memory).</li>
            <li><strong>Fast Access</strong>: The CPU can read and write data from RAm much faster than from a hard drive or SSD.</li>
            <li><strong>Random Access</strong>: The CPU can go directly to any memory location without reading all the previous ones</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>CPU instructions</h2>
        <p>A CPU instruction have two parts to it, the <strong>Opcode</strong> and <strong>Operands</strong></p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Opcode (operation code)</dt>
                <dd>To either perform an operation like a calculation and load/create/store/read information<br>It basically the guidelines for the cpu to follow to do with the data</dd>
            <dt>Operands (Specify where the data to be used)</dt>
                <dd>Show where is the information is stored or located<br>Basically the address to direct the cpu to do its intended instruction</dd>
        </dl>
        <br>
        <h2>CPu instruction cycle</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fetch: An instruction is read from the memory</li>
            <li>Decode: The retrieved instruction, the operation, abd the necessary addresses/data are all decoded and determined</li>
            <li>Execyte: The ALU performs the operation according what is specified in the instruction</li>
            <li>Store: The results of the operation are stored back into memory when indicated</li>
        </ol>
