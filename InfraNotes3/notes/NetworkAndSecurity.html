		<h1>2025-11-24 and beyond: Networking and Security</h1>
		<h2>Network</h2>
		<p>A network is when multiple devices are connected to each other, either wirelessly or wired.<br>They either share data with each other or share power with each other.</p>
		<br>
		<p>They require these aspects:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Connection</li>
			<li>Communicate</li>
			<li>Resources</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Network Types</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>Local Area Network (LAN)</dt>
				<dd>Covers a small area like home or a school Lab</dd>
			<dt>Wire Are Network (WAN</dt>
				<dd>Connect multiple LANs in large areas like between cities</dd>
			<dt>The Internet</dt>
				<dd>Global network of networks</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h3>Network Hardware</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Network Interface Card (NIC)<br>Allows a computer to connect to a network, can be wired or wireless</li>
			<li>Switch<br>Connect devices in the same local network, sends packets of data</li>
			<li>Router<br>Connect to networks. Forwards packets to other networks (e.g., your ISP (your internet Provider)</li>
			<li>Modem<br>Convert data from and to your ISP</li>
			<li>Transport medium<br>Transport your data across the ISP or other providers Network</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>How networks work?</h3>
		<p>A network is like a postal system</p>
		<br>
		<p>Data = letters</p>
		<p>IP addresses= Street addresses</p>
		<p>Routers = post offices</p>
		<p>Protocols = rules of delivery</p>
		
		<br>
		<h3>Internet Service Providers (ISP)</h3>
		<p>Your modem connects to your internet service provider (ISP)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bel, Videotron, etc...</li>
			<li>We pay to connect to their ISPs, hardware they maintain and operate</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>ISPs connect to even bigger networks called</p>
		<h3>Network Service Providers (NSPs)</h3>
		<p>NSPs provide access to the “internet backbone”, the high speed “highways” of the internet</p>
		
		<h3>How Networks work: Data (Packet), The letters</h3>
		<p>When you send data (your letter) over a network (webpage, email, file), you computer<br>doesn’t send it as one big piece. Instead, it breaks the data into small units called packets<br>each line of your letter being sent separately).</p>
		
		<p>Each packet contains:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Header -> Control information (source & destination IP, sequence number, protocol)</li>
			<li>Payloud -> Actual file data which is carried</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>This is basically your message, your mail or letter you wabt to send to a friend</p>
