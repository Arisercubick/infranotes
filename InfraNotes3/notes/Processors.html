    <h1>Processors</h1>
    <p>Processors is the brain of the computer, controlling all<br>of the components of a computer and executing their functions</p>

    <p>Top companies that produces these chips are <strong>Intel</strong> and <strong>AMD</strong> with other manufacturers existing but not as dominant compared to these two behemonths</p>

    <h2>CPU Architecture</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Control Unit</strong>: Feeds input and produces outputs of the cpu</li>
        <li><strong>Arthmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</strong>: Produces the arthmetic and logical operations of the cpu</li>
        <li><strong>Registers</strong>: Small and highspeed storage which the cpu can access quickly as it is inbuilt within the CPU for the ALU to access</li>
        <li><strong>Main Memory Unit</strong>: It is the place where the cpu can hold temporary or permanent memory (Through either the memory or storage respectively)</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h2>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h2>
    <!--TODO: Finish this off later on-->
    <ul>
        <li>It is the key part of the CPU (Central Processing Unit</li>
        <li>It performs all the arithmetic and logical operations that a computer needs to process data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Main memory unit (Random Access Memory)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Random access memory is the main memory of a computer where data and programs are temporaily stored while the cpu using them</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary access:</strong> holds data and while the computer is on</li>
		<li><strong>Fast Access:</strong> The CPU can read and write data from RAM much faster than from a hard drive or SSD which is a permanent storage</li>
		<li><strong>Random Access:</strong> The CPU can go directly to any memory without needing to read the previous address</li>
    </ul>
	
	<h2>Registers:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Small</li>
		<li>High speed storage located inside the CPU used to hold data, instructions and addresses</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Control Unit (CU)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>It orchestrats everything like an electrical conducter passing electricity</li>
		<li>It passes data around</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>CPU instruction cycle</h2>
	<p>Fetch -> Execte -> Decode</p>
	
	<h2>Processor Speed</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Speeds are measured in gigahertz (GHz)</li>
		<li>1 Hertz = 1 clock cycle per second</li>
		<li>Most processors are near 5 GHz</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Cache</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A small, very fast memory inside or close to the cpu</li>
		<li>Faster than the RAM</li>
	</ul>
