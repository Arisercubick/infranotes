    <h1>Processors</h1>
    <p>Processors is the brain of the computer, controlling all<br>of the components of a computer and executing their functions</p>

    <p>Top companies that produces these chips are <strong>Intel</strong> and <strong>AMD</strong> with other manufacturers existing but not as dominant compared to these two behemonths</p>

    <h2>CPU Architecture</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Control Unit</strong>: Feeds input and produces outputs of the cpu</li>
        <li><strong>Arthmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</strong>: Produces the arthmetic and logical operations of the cpu</li>
        <li><strong>Registers</strong>: Small and highspeed storage which the cpu can access quickly as it is inbuilt within the CPU for the ALU to access</li>
        <li><strong>Main Memory Unit</strong>: It is the place where the cpu can hold temporary or permanent memory (Through either the memory or storage respectively)</li>
    </ul>
