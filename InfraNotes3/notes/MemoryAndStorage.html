		<h1>2025-10-20: Memory and Storage</h1>
		<p>Memory and storage are one of the main components of a computer being able to function</p>
		
		<h2>Memory</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Memory is used when programs are running</li>
			<li>Temporary Storage, meaning if the power is cut, it will turn off</li>
			<li>Faster compared to the storage</li>
			<li>Volatile, meaning it turns off and deletes data when the power is off</li>
			<li>It is generally smaller than the storage</li>
			<li>It is used for immediate and short term needs</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Kinds of Memory</h3>
		<p>It is an umbrella term which contains:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Cache</li>
			<li>Main Memory (RAM)</li>
			<li>Read Only Memoruy (ROM)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Memory is also a trade off, you either want Speed or Capcity due to the cose</p>
		
		<p>(Bandwith Increases) (CPU) -> Cache Level1 -> Cache Level2 -> Cache Level3 -> RAM Memory -> Mass Storage (Latency and Size increases)</p>

		<h2>Storage</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Include documents, pictures, videos and operating system file</li>
			<li>Long term memory of the computer</li>
			<li>Non-Volatile, meaning it stores data even when the power is off</li>
			<li>Slower compared to the memory of the devices</li>
			<li>It is generally larger than the storage</li>
			<li>It is used for long term needs</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Levels of Cache</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>L1</dt>
				<dd>Fastest, smallest in size, usually most expensive</dd>
			<dt>L2</dt>
				<dd> Very Fast, medium in size</dd>
			<dt>L3</dt>
				<dd>Slowest, largest in size</dd>
			<dt>Ln</dt>
				<dd>Can go on constantly depending on architecture</dd>
